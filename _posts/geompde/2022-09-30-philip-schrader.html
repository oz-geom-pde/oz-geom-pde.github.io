abstract: I will talk about Sobolev gradients and introduce a particular gradient of the bending energy of curves. I'll explain where this gradient fits among the various curve-straightening flows studied previously. Then I will outline the general method for using gradient inequalities to prove convergence of gradient flows. Reparametrisation symmetry of the bending energy makes it impossible to obtain a Lojasiewicz-Simon gradient inequality by standard methods. I will explain how to get around this and prove convergence for our Sobolev gradient flow. This is joint work with Shinya Okabe.
