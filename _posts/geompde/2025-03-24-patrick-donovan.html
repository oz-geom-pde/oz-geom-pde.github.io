abstract: Gradient Ricci solitons are generalisations of Einstein manifolds and are important in the study of Ricci flow. Gradient Ricci solitons with strong symmetry are well studied in dimension 3 and below. We construct new large families of asymptotically conical 4-dimensional expanding cohomogeneity one gradient Ricci solitons. We also investigate the uniqueness of compact cohomogeneity one gradient Ricci solitons.
