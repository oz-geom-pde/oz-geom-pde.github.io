abstract: The last few decades have seen several developments which begin to foreshadow an emerging picture of the relationship between the deformations and moduli of complex manifolds and the curvature of the parameter and total space of the deformation.  In this talk, we will describe this rich and vibrant picture together with a discussion of open problems and prospective applications.
