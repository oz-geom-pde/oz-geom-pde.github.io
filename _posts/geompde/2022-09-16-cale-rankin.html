abstract: We discuss some recent results for generated Jacobian equations. These are a class of equations which use techniques developed for the study of Monge–Ampère equations to study problems in geometric optics. Thus, we'll begin with an overview of the geometric and convexity based techniques used to study analytic properties of solutions to the Monge–Ampère equation. Then we'll define generated Jacobian equations and explain how the framework for these equations allows us to employ generalisations of the techniques used for the Monge–Ampère equation. Finally we'll outline what we can do with this new framework; we survey some recent regularity and uniqueness results and sketch their proofs.
