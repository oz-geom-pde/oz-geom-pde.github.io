abstract: We study an anisotropic planar curve shortening flow in the presence of an ambient vector field.  We state some preliminary results highlighting behaviour that differs from curve shortening. The main objective of this talk is to outline the proof a Gage-Hamilton type theorem for sufficiently strongly convex curves and bounded vector fields.
