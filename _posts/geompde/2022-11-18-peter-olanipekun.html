abstract: Due to its wide application in different areas of Science, the study of the Willmore energy has been an area of active research in geometric analysis. Generalising the Willmore energy to higher dimensions has been a question of interest in geometry for a long time. In this talk, I will extensively describe a four dimensional conformally invariant energy (which generalises the Willmore energy) and show that its critical hypersurfaces are indeed smooth.
